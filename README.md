**This is Task 1 - OOP for Sumerge's Software Talent Program**

*Description:*

Create a simple command line quiz application using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The application should create a random quiz (pick a random mix of questions) and display these questions to the user sequentially through the command line. The application should display the user scores after they finish the question.

*Classes and Objects:*

1. ﻿﻿Question: Represents a single quiz question. Should have attributes for the question text, possible answers, and the correct answer.
   
﻿﻿2. Quiz: Represents a collection of questions. Should have methods to add questions, display questions, and calculate the score based on user responses.

﻿﻿3. User: Represents a user taking the quiz. Should have attributes for the user's name and methods to record their answers and track their progress.
  
4. Quiz Application: Manages the overall application flow, including user registration, quiz creation, displaying quizzes, recording responses, and showing progress.
